# Freedome
Freedome is a project management tool that can be self hosted or you can create 
an account at freedome.us. 

It is the goal to eventually have this project management tool connected to the 
fediverse using ActivityPub protocol so project updates are available to not just 
users of Freedome, but also Mastodon users or anyone else on the fediverse wishing 
to follow a project. 

## Creators
Freedome was created by  Dillon Ashida-Schwisow, Katy Brown, Kyle Eyeye, and 
F. Joe Nichols as part of their Senior Project at NMSU in Summer 2024.
